- Autoprefix and minify CSS and put it inside `dist` directory
- Compile ES6+ to ES5, concatenate JS files and minify code
- Compress and copy images into `dist` directory
- Copy dependencies specified in `package.json` from `src/node_modules` directory into `node_modules` folder inside `dist` directory
- Import dependencies into your application with ES6 modules
- Spin up local dev server at `http://localhost:3000` including auto-reloading

## Getting Started
In order to get started, make sure you are meeting all requirements listed above.
Then, just go ahead and download the Gulp Starter Kit. For this, you can choose between the following options:

### `npm init`
The recommended way of downloading the Gulp Starter Kit uses the command `npm init` and the [`create-gulp-starter-kit` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jr-cologne/create-gulp-starter-kit) as the initializer.

For this, just follow these steps:

1. Execute `npm init @jr-cologne/gulp-starter-kit your-project-name`. This creates a folder called `your-project-name` (change that to your project name) at the current location where your terminal / command prompt is pointing to. Moreover, this initializes your project and installs all dependencies.
2. Change your working directory to your project folder by executing `cd your-project-name`.
3. Spin up your web development environment with the command `npm start`.
4. Start coding!

In case you are lazy, just use this command:

```bash
npm init @jr-cologne/gulp-starter-kit your-project-name && cd your-project-name && npm start
```

### `git clone`
The other way of downloading the Gulp Starter Kit is by cloning this Git repository. Before executing any commands, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your computer.

Then, follow these instructions:

1. Execute `git clone https://github.com/jr-cologne/gulp-starter-kit.git your-project-name`. This creates a folder called `your-project-name` (change that to your project name) at the current location where your terminal / command prompt is pointing to.
2. Change your working directory to your project folder by executing `cd your-project-name`.
3. Install all dependencies by executing `npm install`.
4. Spin up your web development environment with the command `npm start`.
5. Start coding!

If you are lazy, just do everything at once:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jr-cologne/gulp-starter-kit.git your-project-name && cd your-project-name && npm install && npm start
```

## Usage / FAQ
### How to install the Gulp Starter Kit into the current working directory?
You can install the Gulp Starter Kit into the current working directory by appending `--current-dir` to the end of the `npm init` command.

Example:
```bash
npm init @jr-cologne/gulp-starter-kit your-project-name --current-dir
```

### What kinds of build scripts does the Gulp Starter Kit offer?
The Gulp Starter Kit offers two different build scripts:

1. `npm run build`: This is used to build all files and run all tasks without serving a development server and watching for changes.
2. `npm start`: This is the normal development script used to build all files and run all tasks, but also to serve a development server and watch for changes.

### How can I use another CSS preprocessor than Sass?
In case you prefer to use one of the other supported CSS preprocessors over Sass, you can simply create a new directory `src/assets/css-processor-name` which is where all your CSS preprocessor files have to be placed.
After you have moved all your code to the new folder, just make sure to delete the `sass` directory and everything should work as expected.

Here's a list of the currently supported CSS preprocessors and the corresponding directory names:

- Sass (`src/assets/sass`)
- SCSS (`src/assets/scss`)
- Less (`src/assets/less`)
- Stylus (`src/assets/stylus`)

### How can I specify for which browsers CSS code should be autoprefixed?
The recommended way of specifying which browsers should be targeted by the CSS autoprefixer is to add a `browserslist` key to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "browserslist": [
    "last 3 versions",
    "> 0.5%"
  ]
}
```

You can find [more information on that topic](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#browsers) in the README file of the employed [PostCSS plugin](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

### What types of images are supported?
The following types of images are currently supported:

- PNG
- JPG / JPEG
- GIF
- SVG
- ICO (not compressed)

### How can I specify dependencies which are then copied to the `dist` folder?
You don't need to specify your dependencies anywhere else than in your `package.json` file.
Just install your dependencies via npm and all your dependencies get automatically loaded and copied into the `dist` folder.

### How can I load dependencies inside my application?
ES6 modules are supported by this Gulp Starter Kit.
Just install your dependencies and import them like so:

```js
import axios from 'axios';
```
